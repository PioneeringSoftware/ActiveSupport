/**
 * Formats and parses date-times using a sorted collection of Cocoa date
 * formatters.
 *
 * The Active Support date formatter encapsulates a collection of
 * Foundation date formatters. Conversions between strings and dates, and vice
 * versa, occur by asking a prospective date formatter for a conversion followed
 * by a reverse conversion. If the latter matches the input, either string or
 * date, conversion succeeds. This is a longer, more rigorous conversion
 * algorithm but proves more reliable. Conversions to and from strings
 * effectively test themselves.
