/**
 * Makes an underscored and lowercase form of the given string. Replaces
 * double-colons with slashes. Two or more capital letters followed by lower
 * case letters become separated words, separated that is by an underscore; the
 * underscore appears before the last capital, e.g. ABCdef becomes ab_cdef
 * assuming that Cdef is a meaningful word. Similarly, a1A becomes
 * underscore-separated as a1_a. Finally replaces dashes for underscores and
